# Controle Financeiro

This repository contains a basic ASP.NET Core solution with multiple projects:

- **ControleFinanceiro.Api** – entry point API project with controllers.
- **ControleFinanceiro.Application** – application services.
- **ControleFinanceiro.Domain** – domain entities and repository interfaces.
- **ControleFinanceiro.Infrastructure** – data access implementations.
- **ControleFinanceiro.Shared** – shared utilities and constants.

The solution demonstrates a clean architecture approach. All classes are kept
simple and only provide minimal placeholder logic.
